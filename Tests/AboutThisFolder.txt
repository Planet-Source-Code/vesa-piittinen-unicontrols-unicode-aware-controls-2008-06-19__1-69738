From here you can find some development stage or test projects:
---------------------------------------------------------------

SelfControl = self-contained IOleInPlaceActiveObject in an user control

SelfTimer = self-contained timer class module

UniForm = pre-UniCaption test project that became unrequired when I figured out the easy solution

UniMenu, UniMenu2, UniMenuItem = all kinds of random work for a new UniMenu
